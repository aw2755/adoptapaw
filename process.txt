*** 'node --env-file=config.env server'
    * this is used to test the connection to the server, will show the messages:
        "Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!
         Server listening on port 5050"

1. MERN tech stack (refer to 'MERN.png' for reference):
    - MongoDB for database.
    - Express.js for backend.
    - React for frontend.
    - Node.js for backend.

2. Create a config.env file used to store sensitive data.

3. Creating a server directory that will handle all server request and backend logic.
    - 'npm init -y' will initialize a project and create a package.json in a node.js project.

    - 'package.json' acts as the blueprint for the project, providing all the information required 
        to install, manage, and run it effectively.
        - adding ("type": "module") will allow node to use ES modules(ECMAScript Modules) which is
            a modern, efficient, and clean way of organizing JavaScript code, making it easier to 
            maintain and scale, especially in large projects.

    - now we can install the rest of our dependencies.
        - 'npm install mongodb express cors'  --> creates the node_modules directory and package-lock.json.
            - mongodb installs the node.js database driver which allows us to connect to database.
            - express is the web framework for node.js, making our lives easier by:
                * Simplifying HTTP request handling and routing.
                * Offering middleware for common tasks like logging, parsing data, and serving static files.
                * Providing flexibility in routing and project structure.
                * Allowing seamless integration with templates, databases, and front-end frameworks.
                * Reducing boilerplate code and improving productivity in web development.
            - cors(cross-origin resource sharing) is a package used for security features implemented by
                web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different domain.
    
    - server.js file is used to start the Express.js server.
        1. importing dependencies.
            - express is used for handling routes.
            - cors(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows the server to handle request from diff domains.
            - records is the database.
        2. setting up the port, defaults to 5050 is not defined.
        3. creates an instance of the Express application.
        4. using middleware to parse json data sets.
        5. defining a route to handle requests.
        6.. starts server on specified port and listens to incoming requests.
    
    - db/connection.js file is used for connecting to the database and pulling from it.
        1. imports MongoDB client and API version.
        2. sets up MongoDB URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)
            * A URI can be thought of as a way to address a resource so that it can be located and interacted
                with, such as a web page, a file, or a database.
        3. it creates a MongoDB client instance with the correct version and other checks.
        4. connects to MongoDB server.
        5. pings the server to check for successful connection.
        6. tries to access the pet database, if doesn't exists create one.
        7. export the pet database so other parts of the application can interact with it.

    - routes/record.js file is used for CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
        1. imports express, db, and ObjectId.
            * express is used to create web server and define routes.
            * db is the database object passed back from db/connections.js.
            * ObjectId is a utility provided by MongoDB to convert string representation of document
                id into MongoDB ObjectId object which is used by MongoDB to uniquely Identify documents.
        2. define routes for endpoints to handle https responses.
        3. write CRUD functionalities:
            * get ALL records.
            * get by one record by id.
            * create a new record by id.
            * update an existing record by id.
            * delete an existing record by id.
        4. the specific res.status:
            * 404 = not found.
            * 200 = ok.
            * 500 = internal server error.
            * 400 = bad request.

4. Creating a Client directory that will handle frontend design.
    - npm create vite@latest client -- --template react.
        * creates a new project with vite, a modern build tool with the latest version.
        * creates this in a directory called client.
        * the first -- tells vite not to npm install itself.
        * --template tells vite to use the react template.
    - npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer.
        - these are development dependencies.
        - tailwindcss is a CSS framework used to quickly style applications by composing 
            utility classes directly in your HTML.
        - postcss is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
        - autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes to 
            CSS rules to ensure compatibility across different browsers.
    - npx tailwindcss init -p.
        - initialize tailwind config and creates the tailwind.config.js file.
            * add:
                "./index.html",
                "./src/**/*.{js, ts, jsx, tsx}",
              in content[] to let tailwind know which files to apply the CSS on.
            * add:
                @tailwind base;
                @tailwind components;
                @tailwind utilities;
              in src/index.css to utilize predefine class name.
    - npm install -D react-router-dom.
        - adds client side page routing to react.
